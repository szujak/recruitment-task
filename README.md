# Task for candidates

Prepare simple react app to search github users and present their repositories.

Keep it simple, focus more on good code quality and architecture than on styling everything.

Rules:
- For data presentation use React
- For state management use redux/redux-observable
- You should prepare 2 views:
  - First one with search input and live results (no pagination, just display up to 10 matched users)
  - Second one with detailed view of user which will be displayed after click on single result (feel free to arrange it by yourself)
- Make it mobile first

Additional:
- Try to use GraphQL to fetch data
- Make it PWA
