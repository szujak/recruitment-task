# Task for candidates

Prepare simple react app to present github repositories for a given username.

Keep it simple, focus more on good code quality and architecture than on styling everything.

Rules:
- For data presentation use React
- For state management use redux/redux-observable
- You should prepare 2 views:
  - First one with search input and live results (no pagination, just up to 10 elements)
  - Second one with detailed view of user which will be displayed after click on single result (feel free to arrange it by yourself)
- Make it mobile first

Additional:
- Try to use GraphQL to fetch data
- Make it PWA
